[Core] Added click events to buttons in v2.Form.prototype.addButton to track
       which button caused a submit.

[Core] Removed v2.target() which relied on proprietary functionality (ie, bad
       cross browsersness)

[Core] Wrapped v2.Field.prototype.validate in an anonymous function when run as
       an event handler for field elements to avoid a false return value to
       break radio buttons and checkboxes in IE6+7

[Reporting] onFailure no longer creates an empty list if it's configured to
            display 0 messages.
